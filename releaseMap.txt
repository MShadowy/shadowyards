0.6.5 Roadmap
    Add Enkidu-class special actions frigate


0.6.2 - 0.6.4 Roadmap
    
    
    ToDo Sounds:
        Sounds for built in weapons (Phase Beam) *P4
        Systems still using vanilla sounds: Booster Jets, Woop Drive, SWACS, Siege Mode, Afterburner, Jammer
        Generic Sound effects still using vanilla sounds: Ship Explosions, Shields up/down, EMP Loop/Overload Explosions - 4; EMP - Start sound effect and loop
    Test Give light CEPC and Chaingang AoE flak effect that only goes off at the end of their range
    ToDo Change the Mimir main gun to make it more effective
        No longer fully pierces targets, instead losing range at each tick of piercing
        Damage per tick no longer treated as a percentage divided by the target ships collission radius, instead determined by hull type
        Bug Tartiflette about visual effects, yeesh
    ToDo Implement Gleise Field Effect in Anar
        Generates false sensor contacts, obfuscates details of actual contacts within field
        If implemented and Berins stash gets commented out, make it a favored spot for pirates to spawn
    ToDo Design and add Cargo and Fuel Cruisers since Eitri concept apparently won't work
    ToDo Complete mission and lore rewrite
    ToDo Improve Mimir AI by adding officer specific routines
        Aggressive:  Charge happy, aggressively uses it to close, not too worried about ramming though it still would prefer not to
        Standard: As current fixes; standard behavior
        Cautious: Will try to avoid using it except to avoid damage; only uses it for getting around if it's sure it won't hit anything, probably won't do so in combat
        Timid: Hyper sensitive to incoming damage, never uses it to advance, has a special routine that tries to figure out if the vector will lead it further from enemies and use 
        it if it does so
    ToDo Adjust Seski's ship system to be a "Fractal Displacer"; single charge at any given time, charges reasonably quickly (not sure how to implement)
        Consists of several (6-10) short displacements chained together in a burst.  At each jump the ship gets the vector of the last jump (or initial vector) and modifies it within a range
        EMP lightning bursts follow behind
        Individual jumps have a vey short duration, but the overal time taken should be longer than a wolf jumping three times rapidly
        Total range covered should be 1.75 - 2.5 standard displacer hops
        Cycle time should be 1.25 - 2 displacer charging cycles
    ToDo Adjust beam behavior to work off new BeamAPI hooks
        Urumi - beams converge towards target
        Trishula - Three round burst with offset (anti-fighter beam behavior)
    ToDo Improve Tartarus Siege Mode AI
        Need to take some time to visualize how to improve it
        Should use it when it is either a) in danger of being flanked or b) wants to get some extra range to focus down an enemy with
        Should avoid using when it is retreating or trying to otherwise diesngage unless outnumbered by enemies massively faster than it is (i.e. most frigates, some destroyers)
    
    Add the Eitri-class Modular Industrial Ship(todo: sprite partially finished):
        lots of variants; has a "Modular Industrial Tray" system that lets it fill multiple commercial/industrial applications
                not actually a ship system
        most notoriously is that of a deep space refinery ship allowing for efficient mineral extraction in remote systems
        most common is cargo transport, though
        can also do research and function as a slightly less draining construction rig
        also, pirate versions of these are capital scale carriers(!)
        Versions avaialbe for this patch: cargo hauler-refinery(in this version of things, more like a larger Venture)-pirate carrier
    Add Archipelago Construction Ship(sprite started, stalled):
        can rapidly restock and supply ships in fleet, and construct new ships/supplies if enough materials are present (the last is very unlikely to be implemented until industry is in)
        system is intended to be a massive scale "drone" system -- basically has several squadrons of fighters and bombers permanently stationed on board
        not a combat ship by any means; slow, vulnerable, inflexible, armament mostly built in dedicated pd weapons
    Add small extremely rapid fire energy weapon
        In tandem with the above, rebalance light cepc and chaingang to make them more valuable--probably acting as a kind of burst firing flak
    Add Unnamed "Energy Mine" launcher (fires a spray of small missiles which slow down after a moderate distance (~700-900 units); guided so no FF, enemy ships that get too close get blasted)
        probably will have a small and medium version
    Add Unnamed 30 OP Large Mount energy weapon that basically does what the old Pandora Array did.
    Add a local pirate faction (the Zaikan Cartels) for Pirates in and around SRA territory to make use of said ships and SRA uglies/bashes
    Add Redwings subfaction and skins to Shadowyards
        The Redwings are an elite unit, fleets are commanded by high level commanders.
        Have a special refit only present on these ships which improves flux stats, armor and OP.
        Redwings craft cannot normally be obtained, and are available only via boarding or as rewards for completing high level missions. 
        Ships: Enlil, Seski, Shamash, Morningstar, Clade, Sargasso, (plus Enkidu [which, thinking about it, is probably only available to RW units], Solaris and Minarette when made) Charybdis, Scylla, Tartarus, Mimir, all Fighters
        If possible, Redwings have some special behaviours:
            Unlike the Lions Guard, the Redwings are specifically dispatched for problematic situations and are not normally flying around on patrol.
            RW Units are mostly used as a special response unit, and are likely to be dispatched to protect SRA assets under particular duress (as such they're likely to be deployed to Gigas in the base campaign to defend Stillness.)
            RW units will also spawn to lead SRA task forces in defending allies from Templar attacks if Templars are enabled.
                If Anar is directly threatened by a Templar encroachment all available RW fleets will spawn, with at least 1 to defend Euripides.
                    Fleet allotment if all fleets available: (2 Euripides, 2 Theramin, 1 Lumen, 1 Patrol; Order/Priority - Euripides, Theramin, Euripides, Lumen, Theramin, Patrol)
                This will require a special fleet manager, even sans Templar interactions; a Nexerelin hook may also be needed (though in all likelihood I'll just keep the RW out of it)
                    Redwings will have a maxFleets tracker to ensure that only so many can be in play at one time (tentatively 6 fleets)
                    There will also be a certain amount of enforced downtime; downtime is higher if a fleet has been destroyed.
                        Unlikely to be an issue unless RW units have been taking very heavy casualties or if all untis have been deployed at once.
                    While perhaps unecessary, it may be possible to force the unit to disband if all fleets have been destroyed and none can spawn.
    Rewrite mission descriptions and go over lore to update them to current standards, and improve mission scenario implementation
    Adjust Seski's ship system to be a "Fractal Displacer"; single charge at any given time, charges reasonably quickly (not sure how to implement)
                Consists of several (6-10) short displacements chained together in a burst.  At each jump the ship gets the vector of the last jump (or initial vector) and modifies it
                within a range
                EMP lightning bursts follow behind
                Individual jumps have a vey short duration, but the overal time taken should be longer than a wolf jumping three times rapidly
                Total range covered should be 1.75 - 2.5 standard displacer hops
                Cycle time should be 1.25 - 2 displacer charging cycles
    Improve Mimir AI by adding officer specific routines
                Aggressive:  Charge happy, aggressively uses it to close, not too worried about ramming though it still would prefer not to
                Standard: As current fixes; standard behavior
                Cautious: Will try to avoid using it except to avoid damage; only uses it for getting around if it's sure it won't hit anything, probably won't do so in combat
                Timid: Hyper sensitive to incoming damage, never uses it to advance, has a special routine that tries to figure out if the vector will lead it further from enemies and use 
                it if it does so
    (Address whatever balance issues come up)
    Add Prototype Fast Attack Cruiser (repurposed original Elysium sprite) as IBB Bounty
                Tentative name: Asphodel
                ship traits; fast, maneuverable, solid armaments package, non standard defensive package
                Things can do with bullet:
                Eat Bullet, Repel Bullet, Teleport Bullet, Ignore Bullet, Make Bullet Intangible, Destroy Bullet, Slow Bullet Down, Speed Bullet Up, Avoid Bullet, Tank Bullet
                Combination of Avoid/Repel - a short, fixed duration Time Slow which gives at least 2x the dilation of a normal phase cloak combined with a repulsion wave when the effect ends
                Has a pretty considerable f/s build up while active
                Limited number of availabe uses at any given time (3-5) whith a slowish regeneration
                Repulsion effect pushes back ships/asteroids/bullets/missiles except the projectiles created by the Asphodels F-Key system
                F-Key is a weapon-type system which does a sizeable amount of damage on a long cd, firing a number of tracking projectiles
                However, when the right click system is active the function changes significantly
                The damage reduces sharply, as does the flux use (but not as much) and the projectiles lose their homing capability
                In exchange the cd becomes very short (something like 1/4 - 1/3 of a second) allowing it to be spammed at the risk of overloading
                As an additional balancing measure when the ships right-click system goes offline, the F-key system is considered to have been used and must go through it's full cd
    Add new Destroyer (Intransigent class?)
    
    
    ToDo: Add Utility ships
        Tanker
        Civilian Transport
    Add HE missile system
        Based off RPG 30, fires pilot round to distract pd with main round following behind
    
    
    ToDo:
        (Optional) Adjust Seski's ship system to be a "Fractal Displacer"; single charge at any given time, charges reasonably quickly (not sure how to implement)

                within a range
                EMP lightning bursts follow behind

                Cycle time should be 1.25 - 2 displacer charging cycles
        Add visual effects for the TAG system (partial)
        (Optional) Improve the visual effects for the SWACs system (add ping effect at Sargasso)
        (Optional) Rewrite mission descriptions and go over lore to update them to current standards and improve mission scenario implementation if time permits
        (Optional) Add Vectored thrusters to the Poseidon
        (Optional) Go over Boss Ship sprites and bring them up to par
        (Optional) Adjust Phasegun to have a secondary explosion effect following shot death and make necessary damage adjustments to account for it
        (Optional) Add visual effects for Potnia's ecm system
