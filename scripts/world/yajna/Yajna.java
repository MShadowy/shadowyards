    /*Shared system between SRA and the Persean League, some indications of tensions
    over the border friction but held up as an exemplar of mutual cooperation between 
    the two powers.
    
    Most of the contention comes over a mineral rich, nominally independent world, Hotri; the SRA 
    technically has a stronger position here with two colonies-Jnana and Karma-in system, but both are smaller 
    than the single Persean League planet, Mantra.  The sytem is quite busy, with not one but two
    highly active Pirate bases, Pillager Point and Maks Hole, in its outskirts.
    
    Total size, 7 Planets, 4, a large ring system around the star and smaller one roughly dividing the 
    system in half; in order planets are Udgatri, Adhvaryu (1 moon, Saptapadi), Jnana (1 moon, Kanda), Hotri, 
    Brahmin, Mantra (2 moons, Soma and Havir), and Karma
